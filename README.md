By providing a centralized platform for communication, coordination, and progress monitoring, Goalden strengthens community bonds and facilitates positive change. Our focus will be for people looking to improve their productivity and motivation, such as students and professionals.

# Technologies & Packages
Our project’s primary platform where we update, view changes, and deploy our website has been on GitHub. It serves as the central hub for project collaboration and version control. For UI and UX design, we used Figma for designing our basic layout of the webpages and used Aseprite to make the pixel art. As for development, we created a web-based application utilizing HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the front end for the styling, animations, functionalities, and jQuery for the animations, providing an intuitive user interface and interactive experience. For the back end, we have been using Javascript and jQuery for the logic in conjunction with Supabase functionalities (which is implementing most of our backend) to be able to retrieve, send and manage data in our database. It also handles the server-side logic and API integrations. To ensure efficient data management, Supabase has PostgreSQL as the database infrastructure which offers robust scalability and reliability. To deploy our website we are using Github Pages static site hosting service. We focused on ensuring that our platform supports real-time updates with minimal latency and can handle concurrent users efficiently. We also focused on ensuring that our users' data is authenticated and protected so it’s used responsibly.
